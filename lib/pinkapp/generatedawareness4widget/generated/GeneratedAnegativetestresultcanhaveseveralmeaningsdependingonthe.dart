/* Text A negative test result can have several meanings, depending on the personal and family medical history of the person who is tested and whether or not a harmful mutation has already been identified in the family. If a close blood relative of the tested person is known to carry a harmful BRCA1 or BRCA2 variant, a negative test result is clear: it means the tested person did not inherit the harmful variant that is present in the family and cannot pass it to their children. A person with such a test result, called a true negative, has a risk of cancer that is similar to that of someone in the general population.
